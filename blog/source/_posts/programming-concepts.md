Programming involves an immense amount of theoretical knowledge. Understandably there can be a steep learning curve to those that are new to the field. Most technology blogs will point you to an introductory programming or scripting language to convey the basics, however they do not provide you with much information beyond that once you establish the basic principles.

### What is a Data Structure and Why do we use Algorithms? 
**Data Structures** are data organizations, managements and storage formats that enable efficient access and modifications. However  _data structures_ alone are not enough to solve complex operations in a technological society. We require a way to take specific input and produce a specific output. **Algorithms**, much like computation, are mathematical or textual in nature. Understanding the order of an algorithm gives you insight on the efficiency of that algorithm given a specific amount of data or input. There are a number of ways to calculate this efficiency, such as: 

* **Time Efficiency** - a measure of the amount of time it takes for an algorithm to execute. 
* **Space Efficiency** - a measure of the amount of memory needed for the algorithm to execute. 
* **Complexity Theory** - a study of the performance of a specific algorithm. 
* **Function/Asymptotic Dominance** - a rule of measure that is more commonly used in Calculus, but can provide a detailed analysis on a specific algorithm 

The industry standard for computing efficiency of an _Algorithm_ is rooted in **Big(O) Notation**:

> Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.

#### Types of Data Structures
Not all data is the same and therefore not all data structures are the same. A brief synopsis of typical data structures includes:

It is through these organizations of data that computer scientist can generate methodologies for searching, sorting, backtracking, branching, etc. There are instances where certain methodologies or algorithms work best with certain types of data structures, which is why it is in your best interest to learn the various types of data structures in detail as well as which data sets they are prioritized for. 

For a deeper understanding of these Data Structures please refer to this [repository](https://github.com/Jzbonner/ProgrammingConcepts) which offers detailed descriptions and examples of various data structures and their applications.
