## Community First. Business by Definition.
What makes a business like Google or IBM run and operate efficiently while still pulling in a noticeable profit? Is it the ingenuity or innovation, the products or services, or the leadership and industry experience that is behind these household names? How do you achieve success not only infancy but throughout numerous stages of growth and development? 

As an organization that is neither a household name nor successful (at least according to our accounting department), we strive to answer these questions each and everyday. Our operating philosophy is not rooted in emulating the successes of those that have come before us. Redefining how we look at both prevalence and reputation in the industry, has lead us to a different approach. Estimating the true value of a business or organization requires a deeper dive into what lies behind the corporate structure. It is taking a good look at the community that has fostered the growth of that company and assessing the individual contributions that have propelled the organization as a whole to new heights. 

### Community ![about-secondary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Developer-Handshake/Developer-Handshake.github.io/org-page/img-media/community.png)
> How do we define our community? By assessing any and everything around us.

We encourage community collaboration and cohesion. With hopes of gaining a diverse group of contributors, we fully expect to bring solutions and ideas to market that will inspire and influence the next wave of developers, entrepreneurs and consumers. Many organizations believe in placing profits above the investment in their workforce, effectively creating a culture that is riddled with insecurity and greed. We strive to increase the quality of our organization through constantly investing in our community, both contributors and audience. Establishing ourselves as a place of business is about providing an ecosystem of commerce where interrelation leads to more than just economic gain.

> How do we do business? By providing opportunities whose value constitute returns on investment along with community growth. 

We provide products and services that redefine the mundane. Simply put - we have no direction to our business model as of yet... or maybe we do, and we are not telling. Either way, numbers often speak for themselves when determining true value. So when we finally receive those fancy matplotlib and seaborn visuals from our data and business analytics team we will be sure to let you know just how well business is doing.  

However, our business philosophy is simple: If technology is the omnipresent entity of tomorrow, we design tools that allow us to navigate that terrain with efficiency.
