## Community First. Business by Definition.
What makes a business like Google or IBM run and operate efficiently while still pulling in a noticeable profit? Is it the ingenuity or innovation, the products or services, or the leadership and industry experience that is behind these household names? How do you achieve success not only infancy but throughout numerous stages of growth and development? 

As an organization that is neither a household name nor successful (at least according to our accounting department), we strive to answer these questions each and everyday. Our operating philosophy is not rooted in emulating the successes of those that have come before us. Redefining how we look at both prevalence and reputation in the industry, has lead us to a different approach. Estimating the true value of a business or organization requires a deeper dive into what lies behind the corporate structure. It's taking a good look at the community that has fostered the growth of that company and assessing the individual contributions that have propelled the organization as a whole to new heights.
